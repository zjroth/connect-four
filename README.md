# Tasks

- Look at (and play around with) the provided setup to make sure you
  understand how things are being executed.
- If you aren't already familiar with HTML tables, read
  http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp to understand how they
  work. (Note: Tables really aren't used very much any more; but they
  have a nice, easy-to-understand structure.)
- Write the function `buildBoard` that returns a string containing an
  HTML table of the given size. The first and last lines of the
  function have been provided.
- Play around with the provided CSS to see how it changes the table.
